# WebSocket Connection Fixes

## Overview
This document outlines the fixes implemented to resolve WebSocket connection issues, particularly those affecting Google Sign-in functionality.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Double URL Processing
- **Problem**: The ENV configuration was adding `/ws` to URLs that already contained `/ws`
- **Impact**: Caused connection failures due to malformed URLs like `wss://domain.com/ws/ws`
- **Fix**: Updated `app/src/utils/env.js` to check if `/ws` already exists before appending

### 2. Connection Timing Issues
- **Problem**: Google Sign-in component had race conditions when waiting for connections
- **Impact**: Authentication requests failed due to connection not being ready
- **Fix**: Implemented promise-based connection waiting with proper timeout handling

### 3. Reconnection Logic Issues
- **Problem**: Manual reconnect during sign-in caused connection instability
- **Impact**: Multiple connection attempts interfered with each other
- **Fix**: Added connection promise management to prevent concurrent connection attempts

### 4. Insufficient Error Handling
- **Problem**: Limited error handling for connection state transitions
- **Impact**: Users received generic error messages without clear guidance
- **Fix**: Enhanced error handling with specific error messages and recovery suggestions

## Files Modified

### Core WebSocket Infrastructure

#### `app/src/utils/env.js`
- Fixed double `/ws` appending in API_URL configuration
- Added intelligent URL processing to handle existing `/ws` endpoints

#### `app/src/utils.jsx` (useSocket hook)
- Added promise-based connection management
- Implemented `waitForConnection()` function with timeout support
- Enhanced reconnection logic to prevent concurrent attempts
- Added connection promise reference to track ongoing connections
- Improved error handling and state management

#### `app/public/env-config.js`
- Removed duplicate `/ws` from runtime configuration
- Ensured clean URL format for WebSocket connections

### Authentication Components

#### `app/src/components/auth/GoogleSignIn.jsx`
- Updated to use `waitForConnection()` instead of manual polling
- Improved connection waiting logic with proper error handling
- Enhanced timeout management for authentication requests
- Added better error messages for connection failures

#### `app/src/components/auth/GoogleAccountLinking.jsx`
- Added connection waiting logic for both link and create account flows
- Updated to use `waitForConnection()` for reliable connections
- Enhanced error handling for connection failures

### Testing and Monitoring Components

#### `app/src/components/WebSocketHealthMonitor.jsx` (New)
- Comprehensive WebSocket health monitoring component
- Periodic health checks with ping/pong functionality
- Real-time connection status display
- Manual health check and reconnection controls
- Compact and detailed display modes

#### `app/src/components/WebSocketConnectionTest.jsx` (New)
- Complete test suite for WebSocket functionality
- Tests connection establishment, message sending, and Google Sign-in simulation
- Detailed test results with success/failure indicators
- Helps diagnose connection issues in development and production

#### `app/src/components/WebSocketTest.jsx`
- Enhanced with connection testing capabilities
- Added connection wait testing functionality
- Improved error display and connection diagnostics

## Key Improvements

### 1. Promise-Based Connection Management
```javascript
const waitForConnection = useCallback((timeoutMs = 10000) => {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        // Handle existing connections, ongoing connections, and new connections
        // with proper timeout and error handling
    });
}, [connectWebSocket]);
```

### 2. Intelligent URL Processing
```javascript
API_URL: (() => {
    const baseUrl = getEnvVar('REACT_APP_API_URL', 'wss://...');
    const cleanUrl = baseUrl.replace(/\/$/, '');
    return cleanUrl.endsWith('/ws') ? cleanUrl : cleanUrl + '/ws';
})()
```

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling
- Specific error messages for different failure scenarios
- Connection timeout handling with user-friendly messages
- Automatic retry logic with exponential backoff
- Clear indication of connection state changes

### 4. Health Monitoring
- Periodic health checks to detect connection issues early
- Ping/pong functionality to measure connection latency
- Real-time status indicators for connection health
- Manual diagnostic tools for troubleshooting

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. Connection Test Suite
Use the `WebSocketConnectionTest` component to verify:
- Basic connection establishment
- Message sending and receiving
- Google Sign-in flow simulation
- Connection recovery after failures

### 2. Health Monitoring
Use the `WebSocketHealthMonitor` component to:
- Monitor real-time connection status
- Perform periodic health checks
- Measure connection latency
- Manually trigger reconnections when needed

### 3. Production Monitoring
- Monitor WebSocket connection logs for patterns
- Track connection failure rates and recovery times
- Monitor Google Sign-in success rates
- Set up alerts for connection health degradation

## Deployment Notes

### Environment Variables
Ensure the following environment variables are correctly set:
- `REACT_APP_API_URL`: Should NOT include `/ws` suffix (will be added automatically)
- `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`: Google OAuth client ID
- `REACT_APP_ENV`: Environment (production/development)

### Cloud Run Configuration
The deployment scripts have been updated to handle URL configuration correctly:
- Backend URL is converted to WebSocket URL automatically
- `/ws` endpoint is appended only when needed
- Environment variables are properly injected at runtime

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Connection Pooling
Consider implementing connection pooling for high-traffic scenarios

### 2. Advanced Retry Logic
Implement exponential backoff with jitter for reconnection attempts

### 3. Connection Quality Metrics
Add metrics collection for connection quality and performance monitoring

### 4. Offline Support
Implement offline detection and queue management for when connections are unavailable

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Double `/ws` in URL**: Check environment configuration and ensure base URL doesn't include `/ws`
2. **Connection timeouts**: Verify network connectivity and server availability
3. **Authentication failures**: Check Google OAuth configuration and credentials
4. **Reconnection loops**: Monitor connection attempts and ensure proper cleanup

### Debug Tools
- Use `WebSocketConnectionTest` for comprehensive testing
- Enable debug logging in browser console
- Monitor network tab for WebSocket connection attempts
- Use `WebSocketHealthMonitor` for real-time status
